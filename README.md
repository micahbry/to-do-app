# to-do-app
The Todo app is a simple web application that allows users to create, edit, and manage tasks in a list. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be responsive and easy to use.

The main features of the Todo app include:

Adding a task to the list
Editing a task in the list
Marking a task as completed or incomplete
Deleting a task from the list
Filtering the list of tasks by completion status
Sorting the list of tasks by text or completion status
The app uses Bootstrap for styling and responsive design, and is built using vanilla JavaScript without any external libraries or frameworks.

The code is organized into a single JavaScript file that defines the app's functionality, and is linked to the HTML file using a <script> tag. The app uses event listeners to handle user input and updates the DOM dynamically to reflect changes to the list of tasks.
